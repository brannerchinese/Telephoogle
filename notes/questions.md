## Questions

 1. How to identify cycles of more than one node? Idea: first check for outright repetition; then find index of last appearance (counting backward from top of stack); then look for pattern in sequence of these indices. Is there a cycle-size that seems non-trivial â€” 4? 5? 6?
 
 1. Assign a number to pairs of languages, representing how long before a cycle is reached. What about sequences of languages? (Try this later.)
 
 1. Is it meaningful to examine edit distance between versions?
